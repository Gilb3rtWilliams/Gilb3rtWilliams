## 🚀 About Me

I am a disciplined and detail-oriented full-stack developer passionate about building **secure, scalable, and user-focused systems**. I enjoy tackling complex problems—whether in software architecture, algorithmic thinking, or competitive chess.

My interests lie at the intersection of **technology, strategic thinking, philosophy, and faith**. I believe strong systems are built not only with good code, but with clear principles, patience, and purpose.

> *Driven by faith, reason, and disciplined execution.*
